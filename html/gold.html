          <p>
          Using Yahoo Finance, historical gold prices (2000-2025) were scraped for XAU/USD. Features were extracted (year, month, day, week, etc.). Various regression models were trained:
          Linear, Polynomial, SVR, KNN, XGBoost, GradientBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest. Best performing (XGBoost) was used for forecasting with matplotlib visualization. Data was converted to multiple currency formats and used in Power BI.
