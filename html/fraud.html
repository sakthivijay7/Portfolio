        <h2>Credit Card Fraud Classification using Python</h2>
        <p>
          Kaggle dataset loaded in Python using pandas. Null values handled and categorical data encoded. Features like Amount, Category, State, Merchant, Location used for model training.<br> Target:is_fraud.<br> Algorithms used:
          Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVC.<br>
          Models stored as pickle files and predictions made based on user inputs.

        Random Forest achieved 90%+ accuracy. Categories like shopping network payment (shopping_net),unclassified sites( misc_net) and grocery point of sale (grocery_pos or supermarket) had some frauds. Overall, most categories were clean.

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
          The project successfully implemented a credit card fraud detection system using various machine learning algorithms. The Random Forest model  with an accuracy of over 90%. The analysis of transaction categories provided  fraud patterns and more robust fraud detection systems.
